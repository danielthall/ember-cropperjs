# Introduction

`ember-cropperjs` is an addon that provides a wrapper around [Cropper.js](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs). Two yielded components are exposed for handling events and programmatically calling methods on the Cropper.js instance.

Want to get started? Run the following command from your Ember application directory:

```sh
ember install ember-cropperjs
```
